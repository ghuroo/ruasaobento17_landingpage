    blog
        photos
        videos

build tree (attach to session, to reduce db requests):
    get all pages
        create object with:
            [
                locale
                    parent
                        child
                            nephew
            ]

build page localizations object:
    get all pages with same parent (& child & nephew)
        for each page
            if iterated page slug matches current page's slug
                add locale parameter to iterated page url
